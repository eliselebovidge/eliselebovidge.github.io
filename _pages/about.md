I am an experienced quantitative researcher who is <i>deeply</i> passionate about using data to better understand health and disability, as well as effectively communicating such insights to those who need them most.

I am particularly skilled at managing complex projects and multiple stakeholders, having led end-to-end projects across health-related domains such as speech behavior, auditory perception, and movement neuroscience.

One of my favorite parts of the research process is crafting easy-to-follow (and accessible!) scientific narratives and visualizations. I strongly believe that access to information and education is a human right, and I actively work to dismantle barriers wherever possible.
