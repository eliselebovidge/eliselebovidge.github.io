I am a quantitative scientist with 10 years of research experience across various health-related domains, including auditory perception, speech production, and movement neuroscience. I am deeply passionate about using data to better understand health and disability, as well as effectively communicating such insights to those who need them most.

My recent research has focused on how people use sensory information to control their movements, with a particular emphasis on people who stutter. More specifically, I am using quantitative neurophysiological research methods (i.e., EEG) to investigate how people who stutter process both auditory and somatosensory information.

I am passionate about clear scientific communication. I thoroughly enjoy crafting easy-to-follow (and accessible!) scientific narratives and visualizations. I strongly believe that access to information and education is a human right. To complement my research and pursue these passions, I co-founded and co-facilitate a science communication seminar for students of various levels.
