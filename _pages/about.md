I am currently a PhD candidate in [Speech & Hearing Sciences](https://sphsc.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, working with [Dr. Ludo Max](https://sphsc.washington.edu/content/ludo-max) in his [Laboratory for Speech Physiology and Motor Control](http://faculty.washington.edu/ludomax/lab/). My doctoral research focuses on how people use sensory information to control their speech movements, with a particular emphasis on people who stutter. More specifically, I am using quantitative neurophysiological research methods (i.e., EEG) to investigate how people who stutter process both auditory and somatosensory information. 

I am passionate about clear scientific communication and I thoroughly enjoy crafting easy-to-follow and accessible scientific narratives and visualizations. I strongly believe that access to information and education is a human right. To complement my research and pursue these passions, I co-founded and co-facilitate a science communication seminar for students of all levels in my department.
