<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am currently a PhD candidate in <a href="https://sphsc.washington.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Speech &amp; Hearing Sciences</a> at the University of Washington, working with <a href="https://sphsc.washington.edu/content/ludo-max" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Ludo Max</a> in his <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ludomax/lab/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Laboratory for Speech Physiology and Motor Control</a>. My doctoral research focuses on how people use sensory information to control their speech movements, with a particular emphasis on people who stutter. More specifically, I am using quantitative neurophysiological research methods (i.e., EEG) to investigate how people who stutter process both auditory and somatosensory information.</p> <p>I am passionate about clear scientific communication and I thoroughly enjoy crafting easy-to-follow and accessible scientific narratives and visualizations. I strongly believe that access to information and education is a human right. To complement my research and pursue these passions, I co-founded and co-facilitate a science communication seminar for students of all levels in my department.</p> </body></html>
